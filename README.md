## About The Project

Hello, fellow visitor.

BaldLionEngine is a game engine built for the sole purpose of learning C++. Hence, the code that you will find here is far from perfect, and the way some challenges were approached might not be the most optimal, but I have learnt a lot in the process and therefore I consider it a victory :)
